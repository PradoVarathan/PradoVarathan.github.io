Implementing meta-analysis enabled to extract the potential research papers and journals published in bioactive compounds isolated from mangrove ecosystem. The meta-analysis of bioactive compounds was initiated with a focus inclined to keywords using the search words: ‘Bioactive compounds’, ‘Mangrove’, ‘gene OR drug’ in WoS, SCOPUS and PubMed to screen the available research in major research publishers such as Elsevier, Taylor and Francis, Emerald, Springer, Wiley and articles to date. The data of papers published as articles in journals were selected and patent paper, review article, conference proceedings were eliminated. Total of 86 and 54 papers was analyzed in SCOPUS, 117 and 41 papers were found to be prominent from WoS and PubMed could generate 38 and 20 papers using two sets of key words . The obtained data were examined in BibExcel and R studio.

## Article

George, B., Varathan, P. & Suchithra, T.V. Meta-analysis on big data of bioactive compounds from mangrove ecosystem to treat neurodegenerative disease. *Scientometrics* 122, 1539–1561 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03355-2

> Meta-analysis was carried using software BibExcel and R program. A total of eight research articles exclusively focused on bioactive compounds as a drug candidate to treat neurodegenerative disease. This article will construct a holistic approach to analyze and explore the vast field of bioactive compounds in the mangrove ecosystem.
