Hi! I am Pradeep, a doctoral student in Bioinformatics and Computational Neuroscience at Indiana University, Indianapolis and Indiana University School of Medicine. Being born in Chennai, India and graduating with the bachelors degree in Biotechnology, I had my eyes set on exploring the connection between biology and computer science, and the very essence of medicine in the future, precision and personlized medicine. I spends my days working on multiple approaches to building tools and analyzing data for precision diagnosis with multiomic data and identification of genetic factors for neurodegenerative disorders especially Alzheimer's disease.

My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in *BMC Medical Genomics*, *Plos ONE*, *Scientometrics* and *Briefings in Bioinformatics*. This [research](research) explores the multiomic approach for deciphering the diagnostics and disease pathology using machine learning and deep learning methods. While primarily focused on Alzheimer's Disease, it also examines methods to implement on other chronic diseases where I have prepared diagnostic methodologies in my internship at Roche Diagnostics for diabetes. Away from academia, I play club intermediate and competitive volleyball and capture film photography in my past time.
